METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    In this we are using a dp array named store which stores that the maximum number of steps to reach at that point. Now let us assume that you are at ith index than to calculate the maximum number of steps what you should do is to first check for i-1 as top and than for i-2 as top and than add them to obtain the answer so here we are doing the same we will add the number of steps to reach i-1 as top and than number of steps to reach i-2 as top and store them for ith index. At last we are all done with the array and hence we cab return the value stored at nth index.


METHOD 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

Approach:-
    Similar Approach but here we are using array to store the values insetead we are storing them into first_last and second_last variable as we need only them to solve the curr poisition.
