Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N). Used For recurssion Stack.

In this what we are going to traverse the tree in inorder manner and also taking account of prev node which will tell us that what is the prev node 
in inorder traversal. Now what is happening with this is that during inorder traversal the nodes are arranged in increasing order so all the nodes 
with same value are traversed in same line hence we can generate there count and check that if their count is greater than max_count or not ad 
update the answer on the basis of their status.

We can also morris inorder traversal but in that consition all nodes are visited two times and hence the time complexity becomes O(2*N) and space 
complexity remains same.
