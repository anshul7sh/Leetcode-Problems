Time Complexity:-O(x+y).
Space Complexity:-O(x).

METHOD 1:-FIRST MOVE VERTICALLY.

Approach:-
    Initially we will make a vector named store of size x and assign all value equal to grid[0][0].Now we will updating the vector store with idea that how the values change when we will move down to that column . After this group we will start a new loop which initially represents the 2nd column and than update the vector store with idea that how values changes to minimum value if we will move from left or from upwards. at the last we return store[x-1] which represents the last value of the grid after we update it. 

METHOD 2:-FIRST MOVE HORIZONTALLY.

Approach:-
    Same as that of above one but the change is that we will first move horizontally not vertically.
