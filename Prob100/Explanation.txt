METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-o(N). For recursion stack.
    
Approach:-
    We will check at each step that is roots value are equla or not. If they were not than we will return false else we will check for their child node and for both trees the passing of arguments are same so that it will return true if they both are same else their traversal is different and hence will return false.
