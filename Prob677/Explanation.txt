Approach 1 :- 

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

Insert Function:

In this we are going to use the trie data structure. Here we are storing the key string in a trie and at end of 
each character we will update the value of the corresponding value with the given value. For the similar string 
we are using a map to store the latest value for a string and if similar string occurs again than we will decrease
previous value of the string from the new value and than add the new obtained value to all prefix string. So by 
doing this we can store the whole prefix strings with corresponding values.

Sum Function:-
In this we will traverse the trie data structure for the give string if the given string is present in the trie 
than we will return the corresponding value else we will return 0 if this string doesn't exist.
