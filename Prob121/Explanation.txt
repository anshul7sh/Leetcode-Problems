METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N^2).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    In this we are using brute force approach to find for each value as buying value that what will be it's max profit. 

METHOD 2:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

Approach:-
    In this what we are going to do is that we are start traversing the vector with min price as INT_MIN if we will encounter with orice less than min price than we will update the value of min price else check that if we will sell at that time than is profit will be greater than previous one or not and if it will than we will update the answer else move forward.
