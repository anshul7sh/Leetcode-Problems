METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    We will use a stack to store the index of the bars. If the value of bar i found to be greater than the stack's top bar's value than it represents that the top of stack bar can spread it's areqa in next bar but uf it was not we have to check fot top bar that till left where it can increase it's area . This can be done using the next top element of the stack . than using this we can calculate the max area which is required
