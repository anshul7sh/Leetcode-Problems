Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this problem we are going to use a stack to store the remaining asteroids. Whenever a new asteroids will come we will first check that is they 
will colloide or not that is current asteroid and the asteroid at the top of the stack, if they will not than we will just add the new asteroid to 
the stack otherwise we will remove all the asteroids which colloides with the current asteroid and will get destroyed due to less weight and if the 
current asteroid remains till last that it will further not colloide with anyother than we will add that one also to the stack and than will go for 
the next, otherwise if it will get destroyed than we will leave this one and check for the next one. After traversing the whole array in the last we 
are with those asteroids which will remains undestroyed due to collision and hence we will return them in a vector data structure.
