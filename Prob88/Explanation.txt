METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N+M).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    In this what we are going to do is that we are setting our pinters to the end of the vectors nums1(of length m) and nums2 and another pointer to the end of the nums1 vector(of length m+n). Now the max value among these poiners will be assigned to the last pointer and changing pointers will get one step back. So by doing this we can merge the arrays so that they will be in increasing order.
