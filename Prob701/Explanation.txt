Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(H). Where H is the height of the binary tree.
Space Complexity:-O(H).

So what we can do in this problem is that we can add the new node as a leaf node to the given binary tree so that it will become easier for us to 
solve the problem. So in this problem first we will find that node whose left or right is NULL and a new node can be formed in that place without 
any problem so that the tree remains binary search tree. Now we will also use the property of BST that left elements are samller and right elements 
are greater, so if the new node to insert has value greater than current node than we will search for the right subtree else go for the left subtree,
so that we can save change time complexity from O(N)->O(H).
