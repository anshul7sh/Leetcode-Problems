Approach 1 :- 

Time Complexity:-O(N^2).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this what we are going to do is to make all points as base points one by one so for this we are using a for loop. Now lwt us assume the first point
as the base point than we will calculate the distance of all the points with from base point and than store it in the map. Now we will traverse the map 
and apply permutation like if any length l has k paths that is k paths have length l than the number of possible tuples formed are k(k-1) so we will 
add that number to the final result. Now we will make second element as the base element and perform same operation than for third , forth and so on.
After each pass we have to clear the map so that previous data will get erased from the map and map will be like new one.
