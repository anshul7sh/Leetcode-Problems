Approach 1 :- 

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Compleixty:-O(N). For Recurssion stack.

To solve this problem we are going to use Recurssion. Using recurssion we will first find the node that has
value equal to key , let say that node as head , now if head had no right vhild than in place of head we will place
the left subtree of the head otherwise if head has right child than we will add head left subtree to left most part
of the head's right subtree and than in place of head we will place the newly formed right subtree and tha return the 
root node of the tree.
