Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    For each point we will check that from that poisition how much long the ointer can move. If the value found is greater than previous maxpoisition than it will be updated with new one.If the value of i become greater than maxpoisition than it will mean that in real scenerion we can't move more than maxpoisition hence we will terminate the loop and with the condition i==nums.size() return the desired result thata if it's than it represents the loop reaches end of the array hence we will return true otherwise it represent that the loop does not reachs end of the loop hence we will return false in that condition.
