METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    For each valid directory we will add that directory in last to a vector and on encounter with "/../" we will remove the last dirctory from the list and for "/./" we will just move forward. At last we will assign these directories into a string using '/' between them .
