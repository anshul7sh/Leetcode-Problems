METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(log(N)).
Space Complexity:-O(N).
    
Approach:-
    In this we are going to use the binary search approach for the squar root as mid. If mid is found to be as a squareroot than we assign res equal to mid else if id is found to be less than original square root (check from condition 1.) than we will search for mid in right part else search for mid in left part. Aand so on we can generate the squarroot.
