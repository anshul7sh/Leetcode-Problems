Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(log(N)).
Space Complexity:-O(1). 

We are using the simple binary search logic that is if in a sorted array the target element is found to be present greater than the middle element 
of the given array than in that case the target element is their in the right mid half of the array and hence we will search with the same algorithm 
over their else we will search for the left half, if the mid element becomes equal to target than we will return the index else if the sub array in 
which we have to find the becomes empty that is no element is present in the array than it represents that this element is not in the list and hence 
we will return -1 in that case.
