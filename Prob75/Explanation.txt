METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    In this we are going to use two pointers approach. Here j represents end of  color while k represents start of 2 color. Now we will itteratethe map and i represents the current element hence when we will encounterc with 0 we will swap it with j inex or on encounter with 2 we will swap it with k . Now an intresting thing to note is that while swap with k we use i-- this is because we don't know thata what this color is hence we have to check it again hence we will again check it hence we wre using this. When i will become greater than k than it represents that the array is sorted hence we can now terminate the loop.
