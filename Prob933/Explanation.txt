Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this problem we are using a queue which store all the recent calls under 3000 seconds. Now on encounter with a new call we will first remove all 
the calls which occured 3000 seconds before that call that is we will remove all the calls whose difference of time is greater than 3000. So after 
removing these calls we have all the calls which occured within a time of 3000 seconds so the size of the queue represents the recent calls within 
3000 seconds and we will return that one as final answer.
