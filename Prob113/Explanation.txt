METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity;-O(N) -- For recurssion Stack of tree traversal

Approach:-
    In this what we are going to do is to traverse the tree in preorder manner. Now we are taking help vector which is used to store the previous nodes and sum as to calculate the sum of the nodes . Now if we reach a leaf node and the sum would become equal to target than we will push that help vector to our result else just go back by removing top element and so on.
