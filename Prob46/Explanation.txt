Approach 1:-

Time Complexity : -O(N !).
Space Complxeity : -O(N !).To store result else we need only O(N) extra space.

Approach:-
    In this what we are going to do is that initially we will store all the integers in a map and than we use backtrack function to for help.In this function we will start to traverse the map from initial and if found any integer having count not equal to zero than we will add that to our tem vector else go for next one.After adding to temp we will first decrease it's count and than again call for the backtrack fnction. At pint when all count;'s become zero or temp size will become equal to N than we will add that vector to res and goes back and so on.
