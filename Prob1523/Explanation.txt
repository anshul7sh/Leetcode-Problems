Approach 1 :-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).

In this we are checking all nubers between start and end which are odd and than return their count.

Approach 2 :-

Time Complexity :- O(1).
Space Complexity :- O(1).

On observing with maths count of odd numbers between 1 and start-1 is start/2 and between 1 and end-1 is (end+1)/2 so we will just their difference which
will tell us the exact result.
