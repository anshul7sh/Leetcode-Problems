    As we Know that what is meant by division is that how many times we can substract divisor from dividend.So in this problem we are ging to use this concept. Now The idea of Bit manipulation is going to be use here. Now let us suppose dividend = 15 and divisor = 3, 15 - 3 > 0. We now try to subtract more by shifting 3 to the left by 1 bit (6). Since 15 - 6 > 0, shift 6 again to 12. Now 15 - 12 > 0,  shift 12 again to 24, which is larger than 15. So we can at most subtract 12 from 15. Since 12 is obtained by shifting 3 to left twice, it is 1 << 2 = 4 times of 3. We add 4 to an answer variable (initialized to be 0). The above process is like 15 = 3 * 4 + 3. We now get part of the quotient (4), with a remaining dividend 3. Then we repeat the above process by subtracting divisor = 3 from the remaining dividend = 3 and obtain 0. We are done. In this case, no shift happens. We simply add 1 << 0 = 1 to the answer variable. Now the end we use to handel is that when divisor =-1 and dividend=INT_MIN than we should return INT_MAX;
