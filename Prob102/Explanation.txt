METHOD 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1).
    
Approach:-
    Like preorder traversal we will traverse the tree generally and we are going to pass the depth of each node also as argument so that we can add that value to respective vector/list. Now on each pass we will check using condition 1 that is any element of that level exist or not. If it will than we will just simply push root-val to that vector else we will make a new vector insize main vector and push the value. After this using recursion we will go for left and right sub tree.
