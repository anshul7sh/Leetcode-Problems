Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

As the given array is circular so in this what we are doing is that we are used to repeat the array from starting after traversing it for the first 
time. So by doing this we can use the property of circuar array without copying the array again to the end. Now to solve this problem we are going 
to use the concept of strictly increasing monotone stack. So according to this concept what is happening is that if we have some elements in the 
stack and now we are on index i than we will pop out all the elements from the stack till the top of the element of the stack wil not become greater 
or equal to the nums[i] where i is the current index. The elements which are popped out have the next greater element as nums[i] hence we will push 
that one to the result vector at corresponding index.
