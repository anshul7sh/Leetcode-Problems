Approach 1:-

To serialize it we will store the preorder traversal of the binary tree in a string with each node's val is seperated with ',' so that during 
deserialization we can differenciate each node from other.

To deserialize the string into tree we will first store the nodes val into a queue so that it will become easy for us to get the next node from the 
store. After this we will simply build the tree with reverse preorder traversal method and return the head node.
