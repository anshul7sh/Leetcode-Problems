Approach 1 :-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

Initially we will store subarrays sum of all the subarrays starting from index 0. After doing this we will traverse this sum array with consideration that 
if the current sum is even and we want odd sum subarray than we want to remove a subarry from the current one whose sum is odd as (odd-even =odd) or vice 
versa. As we need only count hence in this we will take count of the subarray before which are even and which are odd , and according to above rule we will 
calculate the subarrays that have odd count.
