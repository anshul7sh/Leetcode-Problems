Approach 1 :-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(N).

In this we are using a new string to store the result like we will use a string of size same as given string s and than traverse the indices array and 
put the char at index i of string s to the index indices[i] in string res. So by doing this we have the resultant string in our hand.
